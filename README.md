# Choose Starting Gear (DLC Edition)  
This mod allows you to choose your starting gear when starting a new game.  

The idea is to let you choose whatever you want to enable a more varied experience.  

Perhaps you want to be...  
- A repairwoman sent to the Cannery only to be trapped by the First Flare ...  
- A recluse living in Trapper’s Cabin ...  
- A plane crash survivor ...  
- The climber waiting for friends at the Mountaineer’s Hut ...  

... You can now outfit yourself for whatever scenario you dream up!

## Using The Mod  
1. Open the **Options** menu  
2. Open the **Mod Settings** menu  
3. Scroll across to the **Choose Starting Gear** menu  
4. Mod Options:  
   * **Game Default:** Mod is disabled; a new game will have completely unmodified starting gear  
     * Recommended option when starting a new Wintermute (Story Mode) or Challenge game  
   * **Default PLUS:** Add items **in addition** to the default starting items  
     * You will receive the standard starting items  
     * **PLUS** anything you choose in the mod  
     * Example: you want the standard starting gear PLUS a hatchet and some Ketchup Chips  
     * Clothing you add will equip *after* the default clothing and may end up in the outer slot  
   * **Custom:** You will choose all of your starting gear and receive nothing else  
5. To make the menu easier to navigate, items have been separated into the inventory categories:  
   * Clothing  
   * Fire Starting  
   * First Aid  
   * Food and Drink  
   * Tools  
   * Materials  
6. Each category can be toggled to show/hide  
7. Once you have made your choices, click **CONFIRM** to apply your changes (or **BACK** to exit without applying changes)  

   **NOTE:** When setting custom condition values for items, they may start the game off by 1%.

## Notes  

- Not all DLC food items have been included, because there are so many. Items such as canned corn, potatoes, salt, and flour are included. However, final products for cooked recipe cards (soups, pies, etc.) are **not** included. These may be added in the future.  

- If you encounter any issues, please report them on the **Modding Discord server** in the **#moosemeat** channel.
